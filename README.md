# Web Development Tutorial Framework
###### Created by Alexander Six

### About this project:
This project was created to help teach about front-end web development, while giving the sense of working towards something greater by allowing collaboration amongst the people learning.

### How to use this framework:
This is a very simple skeleton project to use. Each student has their own respective directory (marked with their name) that they can use to create whatever kind of website they can imagine. Each directory already contains an index.html entry-point file - which already has an HTML skeleton laid out - and an assets folder that contains subdirectories for all CSS, Javascript, and image files.

Each respective repository can be accessed through the by opening the index.html page in the main directory, and then clicking on the name of the student on the page.

### Learning Outcomes:
By participating in this front-end tutorial, you will learn the following fundamental skills:
  * How to create a basic web page using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript
  * How to use Git (Github) to add to a larger, dynamic project
  * How to link together web pages to form a static website.
